/*
 * Represents a MongoDB projection for an entity.
 *
 * Allows selecting which fields of the entity's `props` should
 * be included (1) or excluded (0) in query results.
 *
 * - E: the entity type for which the projection applies
 *
 * Important:
 *   A projection must **either include fields** (1) or **exclude fields** (0),
 *   but it **cannot mix include and exclude** in the same object,
 *   except for the `_id` field which can be excluded alongside included fields.
 *
 * Example of valid include projection:
 *   const projection: ProjectionFields<MyEntity> = {
 *     name: 1,
 *     email: 1,
 *   }
 *
 * Example of valid exclude projection:
 *   const projection: ProjectionFields<MyEntity> = {
 *     secretField: 0,
 *   }
